Ancistor
=======

`ancistor` - is a play on the word ancestor. It brings to mind the picture of a family tree and how a simple tree-like structure maps the relationship from one node to another. With this app one can take notes and by using hashtags `#` can traverse to other notes using the same hashtags.



# Quick-Start

To get the application running simply 

    git clone https://github.com/DavidRdgz/ancistor.git
    
Then `cd ancistor` and run

    ./activator run
